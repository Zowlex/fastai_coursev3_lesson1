This is lesson 1 homework or "assignment " from Jeremy where he asked us to play around with the notebook and make our own for another data set. 

I collected data from google image using [Fatkun Batch Download Image chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf) and made a folder with 70 photos of American football and 70 photos of soccer labeled as its content so I understood that I have two classes for fnames (football, soccer)
